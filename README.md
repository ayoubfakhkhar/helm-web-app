# My Helm Chart for a sample web app

This repository contains a Helm chart that deploys a web application on Kubernetes using Helm. Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that makes it easier to define, install, and manage applications in Kubernetes clusters.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Kubernetes cluster (minikube, GKE, EKS, etc.)
- Helm ([Install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/))

## Getting Started

To deploy [Application Name] using this Helm chart, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [repository-directory]
2. Customize the deployment by modifying the values in values.yaml according to your requirements.

Install the Helm chart using the following command:
helm install [release-name] ./[chart-directory]
Replace [release-name] with the desired release name and [chart-directory] with the directory containing the Helm chart (e.g., ./my-app-chart).
3. Monitor the deployment using kubectl commands:
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
4. To upgrade the deployment, modify the values in values.yaml and run:
helm upgrade [release-name] ./[chart-directory]
5. To uninstall the deployment, run: helm uninstall [release-name]
